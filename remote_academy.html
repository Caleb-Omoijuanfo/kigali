            One million computer programming jobs are estimated to be created yearly across the globe - thanks to unprecedented growth in the tech sector.
            Here at Remote Academy we pinpoint the key skills needed for the most in-demand jobs and develop courses and diplomas to train our students in those areas.
            That’s why we've developed this two year diploma in front-end web development, which you can complete entirely online with the help of a dedicated counsellor.

            <h3>WHAT WILL I DO AS A FRONT-END DEVELOPER?</h3>
            The front-end developer is a fundamental part of any web team, working closely with back-end developers. They are often in charge of:
            <ul>
                <li>Bringing mock-ups to life in a beautiful and consistent manner</li>
                <li>Communicating with back-end developers for information exchange across the application</li>
                <li>Using best practices to structure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as components</li>
                <li>Writing tests to ensure the site’s front-end accounts for all possible uses</li>
                <li>Ensuring the maintenance and growth of a site’s front-end</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>WHO IS ELLIGIBLE TO ENROLL?</h3>
            This program is accessible to all, but the following recommendations would be helpful:
            <ul>
                <li>A high school diploma / GCSE/WASSCE level</li>
                <li>A good level of English is recommended</li>
                <li>Access to a computer (PC or Mac), headphones, a webcam</li>
                <li>Good internet access</li>
            </ul>
